# Angular Course Card Application

This project was generated with [Angular CLI](https://github.com/angular/angular-cli) version 14.1.0.

This web app uses local server for consuming data coming from api and it is used to show tags, edit the name of the course of any angular course card.

# Installation pre-requisites

IMPORTANT: Please use Node 18 (Long Term Support version). Note that Node 18 is not yet officially supported by the Angular CLI.

# To Run the Development Backend Server

In order to be able to provide realistic examples, we will need in our playground a small REST API backend server. We can start the sample application backend with the following command:

    npm run server

This is a small Node REST API server.

# To run the Development UI Server

To run the frontend part of our code, we will use the Angular CLI:

    npm start

The application is visible at port 4200: [http://localhost:4200](http://localhost:4200)

## Build

Run `ng build` to build the project. The build artifacts will be stored in the `dist/` directory.

## Running unit tests

Run `ng test` to execute the unit tests via [Karma](https://karma-runner.github.io).

## Running end-to-end tests

Run `ng e2e` to execute the end-to-end tests via a platform of your choice. To use this command, you need to first add a package that implements end-to-end testing capabilities.
